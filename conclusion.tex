\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec-conclusion}

To conclude, we believe that the millions of discarded smartphones represent
a significant opportunity, and can be used in many cases as replacements for
sensor nodes in our effort to better instrument the world around us. Despite
not being designed for ultra-low power consumption, smartphones can be
operated efficiently enough to be able to operate continously while
harvesting energy. We are beginning outdoor experiments with commodity solar
panels and plan to use our nodes to gather data to support the Neon citizen
science project. Through intelligent reuse, we can turn techno trash into
treasure.
